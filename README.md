Java Game of Life with GUI and Diverse Life Forms

This repository houses a Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life, enriched with a graphical user interface (GUI) and an object-oriented approach to represent various life forms, each possessing unique attributes and behaviors.

Key Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Experience the Game of Life in an intuitive visual environment, allowing users to interact with the simulation effortlessly.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizing the power of Java's OOP paradigm, this implementation encapsulates life forms as objects, enabling modularity, extensibility, and easy maintenance.

Diverse Life Forms: Explore a variety of life forms, each with its own distinct characteristics, behaviors, and survival strategies. From simple organisms to complex structures, witness the emergence of intricate patterns and interactions.

Customizable Attributes: Modify and customize the attributes of life forms to observe their impact on the dynamics of the simulation. Experiment with different parameters to study the evolution and resilience of life forms in varying environments.

Educational Tool: Ideal for both beginners and experienced programmers, this project serves as an educational resource for understanding concepts such as cellular automata, graphical user interface design, and object-oriented programming principles.
